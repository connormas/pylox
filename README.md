# pylox - and Lox interpreter written in Python
---
This is an interpreter for the Lox language detailed in the book _Crafting Interpreters_ by Robert Nystrom. As of right now (8-11-21) I haven't completed this yet. I'm still working through the book. I've only just begun working on scanning and parsing.

In _Crafting Interpreters_, Nystrom actually makes this first interpreter in Java instead of Python. I chose Python for two reasons. 1: I barely know Java and didn't want to learn a new language along with how interpreters work. 2: I didn't want to just copy code from a book line for line. Translating this to Python felt like a more interactive exercise.

Afterall, its not like I expect anyone to actually use this for anything. I just wanted to learn how these things work.
